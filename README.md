[Play the game here!](https://averyinterestingusername.github.io/Pirate-Attack/game.html)

This is a little browser game where you have to defend your ship from pirates, by typing the words floating above the pirate ships! 

The pirate ships will get faster over time, making the game more challenging!

If a pirate ship crashes into your ship, you lose!

So defend your precious booty from those scurvy scallywags!
